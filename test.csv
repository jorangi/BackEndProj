0,,"Another one of my favorites, anytime Clancy yelled I just saw Mr Krabs though so that was funny",5.0,The Shawshank Redemption
1,Muhammed a,"The movie was an impressive and very high quality movie, but I think it was a bit exaggerated in terms of points, but I think it was a good and high quality movie, and the ending was quite impressive and beautiful.",4.0,The Shawshank Redemption
2,Victor  B,"A great movie overall, not perfect, but in its own way, very special.",4.0,The Shawshank Redemption
3,William B,The best way to begin with a great franchise.,5.0,The Godfather
4,Abe A,"is it a 5? No, but it comes far closer than Goodfellas, which is its only  serious rival amongst American mob movies.

What it has: characterization, possibly the best I've seen in all Hollywood cinema; character growth and development within a solid structure, with a beginning, middle and end, and a compelling tale which only suffers from lacking what appears to be a central dilemma. Weaknesses: although it has a structure, it has a historical feel (though not episodic in the way Goodfellas is) in that it narrates a sequence of events rather than a forcible, necessary logic of inevitable occurrences that issue inevitably around the resolution of one central dilemma. Some of the action feels contingent rather than necessary. The movie also feels rather literary and a tad detached from the viewer, perhaps because of its supreme control; it just doesn't have the immediacy of life, rather it views like life at a remove.",4.0,The Godfather
5,Byron H,"4/4 When life imitates art, you know it's among the most legendary films in history.  Right at the top of the mountain with the likes of Citizen Kane & it's own sequel The Godfather Part II.",5.0,The Godfather
6,Tommy B,"This film is exceptional, from the acting to the costumes, sound design and visual effects, is stunning. This film is the best Batman film out there in my opinion. Heath Ledger  really did an outstanding job of playing the JOKER. HECK,! he redefined what the role of the JOKER was. 
Christian Bale also did an amazing job of playing the BATMAN. His voice acting and how he could change how his style was when he switched from Bruce Wayne to BATMAN. 
This film is a must see. The performances the actors gave and the amazing job of the crew really did amazing üëèüèº.",5.0,The Dark Knight
7,Sachith W,"Without a doubt one of the best films of all time. It has absolutely everything, great story, terrific acting with an out of this world performance from the late Heath Ledger and brilliant set pieces. This is the perfect movie for me and will never get tired watching it. Aaron Eckharts performance is criminally underrated and I think gives the film much heart. Bale as expected knocks it out of the park and takes a backward step to let Ledger showcase his talent. This is the Jokers film. 
Nolan is a master and this still is his masterpiece. Cannot fault anything in this film. Editing is top notch too. The film never felt long, due to the excellent editing. The score was out of this world. 
Main themes are quite deep here. Deep rooted corruption, politics, organised crime and how it controls and affects a city. These are quite relevant today and the film has not aged extremely well.",5.0,The Dark Knight
8,Cavanagh W,Pretty much any Christopher Nolan movie is a must watch. I think this movie is tied with the Dark Knight Rises for the greatest super hero movie ever.,5.0,The Dark Knight
9,Idan Charles L,It this ain't a perfect movie I don't know what is!,5.0,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
10,Jae C,"*heavenly chorus* This movie is...I don't know how to describe how P.H.E.N.O.M.E.N.A.L this movie is. This movie should be in some type of movie hall of fame. It's a great finale to a the greatest trilogy in film history. 1,000,000,000/10, absolute must see.",5.0,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
11,Fucker M,best movie of all time,5.0,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
12,Amir S,It's a diamond and more than that in the world of cinema.,5.0,Schindler's List
13,Dave S,"One word - Masterpiece!
Great acting, directing and cinematography.
Pulls your heart-string from start to finish.
One of the best war movies ever made.
Spielberg‚Äôs best work!",5.0,Schindler's List
14,William B,The best Spielberg film by far. It takes the tragic WW2 event and makes a masterpiece out of it. With a great story and magic ending.,5.0,Schindler's List
